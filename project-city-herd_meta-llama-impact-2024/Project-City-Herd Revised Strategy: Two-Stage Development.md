Revised Strategy: Two-Stage Development Plan
We're focusing on developing Project City Herd in two stages:
Stage 1: A DataStax-powered wizard that helps non-technical users gather the information needed for setting up the backend with LangFlow and DataStax Astra DB.


Stage 2: The Project City Herd chatbot, powered by Llama LLM, accessible either as a tab within the Facebook app or as a standalone website (e.g., austin.cityherd.com), where residents can ask any question about their city.


Below is a detailed walkthrough of both stages, emphasizing the steps a user would take and the variables we need to capture.

Stage 1: City Herd Rancher
Objective: Enable non-technical users to collect and validate city-specific information, preparing it for integration into the chatbot's backend.
User Journey:
Accessing the Rancher:


User Action:
Visit the City Herd Rancher webpage (e.g., cityherd.com/rancher).
The interface is user-friendly with clear instructions.
Entering Location Details:


Input Required:
ZIP Code: Users enter their city's ZIP code.
Alternatively, users can input their City Name and State if the ZIP code is unknown.
Variables Captured:
ZIP Code
City Name
State
System Process:
The wizard uses the ZIP code to identify the city, county, and state.
It fetches basic geographical data to tailor subsequent steps.
Selecting Resources for Data Categories:


Categories Presented:
Public Services (utilities, emergency contacts)
Transportation (public transit, traffic updates)
Education (schools, libraries)
Housing (rental listings, housing assistance)
Healthcare (hospitals, clinics)
Community Events (festivals, local gatherings)
Government Resources (city hall, public records)
User Action:
Select relevant resources for each of the categories by checking boxes.
Option to add additional sources via url or pdf
Variables Captured:
List of selected data categories.
Automated Resource Gathering Using Perplexity:


System Process:
For each selected category, the wizard generates queries to Perplexity.ai.
Example Queries:
"Official utility providers in [City, State]"
"Public transportation options in [ZIP Code]"
It compiles a list of resources: websites, documents, and datasets relevant to the user's location and selected categories.
Reviewing and Validating Sources (RHLF Step):


User Action:
Review the compiled list of resources.
For each resource:
Select it if relevant.
Deselect it if not applicable.
Preview summaries or snippets to assess relevance.
Purpose:
Ensure only accurate and pertinent information is included.
Engage users in curating their city's knowledge base.
Variables Captured:
User selections of relevant sources.
Data Processing and Conversion:


System Process:
Extract content from the selected resources.
Use DataStax tools to convert content into vector embeddings suitable for AI workflows.
Organize data into categories for efficient retrieval.
Behind the Scenes:
DataStax Astra DB stores the processed data securely.
Prepares the data for use with LangFlow and the Llama LLM.
Completion and Confirmation:


User Notification:
Confirmation message indicating successful data collection and processing.
Summary of the data collected, such as the number of resources per category.
Next Steps:
Instructions on how to access the chatbot once it's ready.
Option to receive updates or further assistance.
Summary of Variables to Capture in Stage 1:
ZIP Code, City Name, State
Selected data categories
User-selected relevant sources from the list
Optional: User contact information for updates (email, phone number)

Stage 2: Project City Herd Chatbot
Objective: Provide residents with a Llama-powered chatbot to access city-specific information effortlessly.
User Journey:
Accessing the Chatbot:


Options:
Facebook App Tab (Brainstorm Integration):
Users open the Facebook app and navigate to the "City Herd" tab.
Standalone Website (Hackathon MVP):
Users visit the city-specific website (e.g., austin.cityherd.com or atx.cityherd.com).
Welcome and Onboarding:


Chatbot Introduction:
Greets the user (e.g., "Welcome to City Herd! How can I assist you in [City]?")
Briefly explains its capabilities and how to interact.
Language Selection:
Option to choose a preferred language (e.g., English, Spanish).
User Interaction:


Asking Questions:
Users can type or speak their questions about city services, events, or any local information.
Examples:
"How do I set up electricity in my new apartment?"
"What are the public transportation options near me?"
"When is the next city council meeting?"
Receiving Answers:
The chatbot provides concise, accurate responses sourced from the data collected in Stage 1.
Offers additional options or resources if available (e.g., links to websites, downloadable forms).
Interactive Features:


Follow-up Questions:
Users can ask follow-up questions to get more detailed information.
Feedback Mechanism:
Option to rate responses for accuracy and helpfulness.
Users can report incorrect information.
Personalization and Preferences (Optional Enhancements):


User Profiles:
Option to create a profile to save preferences.
Receive personalized updates or notifications (e.g., local event reminders).
Location-Based Services:
With permission, the chatbot can use the user's location to provide more precise information.
Continuous Improvement:


User Suggestions:
Users can suggest new resources or information to be added.
Provide feedback on missing or outdated content.
System Updates:
Periodic refresh of the knowledge base using updated resources.
Incorporate user feedback to improve accuracy.
Summary of Variables to Capture in Stage 2:
Preferred language
User queries and interactions (for continuous improvement)
Optional: User profile information (name, email) if personalization is enabled
Feedback on responses

Key Components and Steps for Both Phases
Variables to Capture from Users:
Location Details:


ZIP Code
City Name
State
Preferences and Selections:


Selected data categories (Stage 1)
Relevant sources (Stage 1)
Preferred language (Stage 2)
Optional preferences for personalization (Stage 2)
Feedback and Contributions:


Ratings and feedback on chatbot responses
Suggestions for additional resources or corrections
Use of Perplexity.ai:
